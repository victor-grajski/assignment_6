# New Page: Order Status
The user can reach the Order Status page by “completing” the checkout process after adding an item to the cart. After clicking “Place Your Order” on the Checkout page, the user can click “Check Order Status” on the Confirmation page.

Both the lo-fi sketch and the hi-fi mockup are available in my reflection.pdf and in the “mockups” folder at the top level of this repo.
